          “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.
        </span>
        Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other
        people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out
        your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow
        your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want
        to become. Everything else is secondary.

        <p class=" ">
          I'm a big believer in the value of re-consuming the books, ideas, and
          content that have deeply moved you. In recent years, it has become a
          socially acceptable adult flex to talk about how many books you've
          read in a given year. Trust me, I've done it. You can wow people at a
          cocktail party by rattling off facts from the 52 books you read last
          year.
          <br />
          <br />
          But what I've come to realize is that reading 52 books is much less
          impressive than reading one book and being fundamentally changed by
          it. As a rule of thumb: You may read thousands of books in your life,
          but there will only be a few that deeply change the way you think. The
          same applies to ideas and content more broadly.

          <br />
          <br />
          With books, ideas, and content, I have found that the Pareto Principle
          (20% of the inputs create 80% of the impact) is inadequate. In fact, I
          would argue that 1% of the consumption inputs create 99% of the
          impact. When I find one of those top-1% items, I re-consume it
          religiously (at least once per year). While the content may not
          change, you do, so your experience with it changes. You'll pick up new
          perspectives and insights each and every time. It's a beautiful,
          formative thing.

          Technology is nothing. What’s important is that you have a faith in
          people, that they’re basically good and smart, and if you give them
          tools, they’ll do wonderful things with them.
